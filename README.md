# podcast_tracker_SinatraProject

The ListenUp is a web-based Sinatra app that allows users to track the podcasts that they are currently listen to and follow other users through the "podcast feed". Users can add a description of why they listen to a certain podcast and find inspiration from others to expand their repertoire.

To use this app, just clone, run bundle install, and then run shotgun.
